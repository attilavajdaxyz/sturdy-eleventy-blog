# Q2 calendar days
I set up my desk so that my posture is better. I completed the codecademy Python course. It was fun. I applied to apprenticeships. 

```py
def helloWorld:
	print("Hello World!)
```

This old apple keyboard is so loud. But there is the challenge to learn to type comfortably on it. Since it is a hungarian structured keyboard I cannot see the special characters written on the keys, so I rely less on looking at the keys. I listened to a podcast on green software development, and read a few articles on it. It seems like a meaningful area of programming to pursue. I spent whole days learning to code, and it felt really good to do so. Adjusting my trajectory seems to work. I learnt this from James Clear newsletters. Doing habits for a few minutes, is better than not doing at all. I wonder how to create good blogposts. Perhaps by not worrying about it being good. I look at a lot of surfing video clips on Pinterest. Python is similar to Javascript and Ruby. Yesterday I did a challenge in Bash

```bash
	if [[ (( $1 % $2 )) == 0 && (( $1 % $2 )) == 0 ]]; then
		echo "true"
	else
		echo "false"
	fi
```

`&&` can also mean then and `||` can mean else do.  as in

```bash
	(( $1 % $2 == 0 && $1 % $3 == 0 )) && echo true || echo false
```

I had the idea to stay at my level and gain strength. Doing everything in this simple algorithm scripting way. The idea is to write a blog post everyday. Like morning pages.
