# I am interested in creative code
I will try to pursue a free education. Anyway. 5 minutes blog post. I am learning basic mathematics from Khan Academy. Great platform. I was daydreaming about doing a BSc, but it seems wiser to save that money and continue learning. I solved an algorithm puzzle on codewars. I created a creative code page with a simple drawing with p5.js. We went for a walk with the dog. I don't know what to write about. Slope, point slope form, intercept form, standard form, visualizing simple mathematical formulas.
