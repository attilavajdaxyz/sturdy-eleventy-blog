# code learning
I spent an hour learning to code. I am creating the habit of learning to code with solving 8kyu kata on codewars that are the easiest puzzles. I learn a ton from doing it. I learnt that reverse() method in Python reverses the list I apply it to in place and doesnâ€™t return the reference to the list. So while in Javascript `["a","b"].reverse()` would return `["b","a"]` Python returns None ðŸ¥­.
```py
def reverseWords(str):
    return " ".join(str.split(" ")[::-1])
```

I could use this flow of quite simple, what comes to mind and writing it down. So for example I have learned about triangles, about the unit circle, about proving the Pythagorean theorem with the unit circle. I now know that where the hypotenuse of the unit trangle intersects the unit sircle is the (cosÎ¸,sinÎ¸). I know the soh cah toa phrase. This is enough, great. It seems important to accept these easy ideas.

I am spending time learning the basics of maths, it is fun. I am going through the Khan Academy curriculum and I practice and I read up on things. It has a lot in common with computer programming, which is interesting to me. I think I would like to study BSc Mathematics in the future, or pursue something similar with a lifelong learning, free education strategy. I am learning about trigonometry at the moment. Khan Academy is a great platform.

I am practicing creative harmony, going through the chords and chord changes in the Bill Dobbins book Creative Harmony. I am still at the beginning but it is starting to sound real nice.

I am learning from a course on eDx which is a short course about studying mathematics. It is important to think of different solutions to the same problem, and to try to think creatively. For example, 5*18 can be thought of as 5*10 + 5*8, and it can also be thought of as 5*20-10, or 2*18+2*18+1*18, or 9*10. In mathematics everything is connected and thinking in terms of interconnections is important. I watched a few videos about the growth mindset vs fixed mindset which was really inspiring. It is important to make mistakes, because that's when the brain develops. It is also important to try to solve hard problems, to wrestle with solutions. This is what I learnt from the Learning How To Learn course on coursera as well. Now I am aiming to do one 90 minutes learning bout (or less) per day, and I spend time with diffused mode activities like lying down in the garden looking at the sky, or taking long walks.
