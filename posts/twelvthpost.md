# code learning
I spent an hour learning to code. I am creating the habit of learning to code with solving 8kyu kata on codewars that are the easiest puzzles. I learn a ton from doing it. I learnt that reverse() method in Python reverses the list I apply it to in place and doesnâ€™t return the reference to the list. So while in Javascript `["a","b"].reverse()` would return `["b","a"]` Python returns None ðŸ¥­.
```py
def reverseWords(str):
    return " ".join(str.split(" ")[::-1])
```

I could use this flow of quite simple, what comes to mind and writing it down. So for example I have learned about triangles, about the unit circle, about proving the Pythagorean theorem with the unit circle. I now know that where the hypotenuse of the unit trangle intersects the unit sircle is the (cosÎ¸,sinÎ¸). I know the soh cah toa phrase. This is enough, great. It seems important to accept these easy ideas.
