# code learning continued

writing these morning blog pages is my effortless action
We went for a walk with Juci, and it is a nice morning and she bathed herself in rotting carcass and it made her very happy and very stinky. I am grateful for this cup of good coffee. My dopamine went all over the place from applying to jobs and daydreaming about further education and different options of loans. I have the idea that whatever one should like to study at whatever stage of life one should be able to do so easily. For example I want to do software engineering, and it seems so complicated to get to a place where I am in a team, I am getting paid decently and I am mentored and studying.  I can be grateful for what I have now. I think a basic universal income would be a good to have. If someone wants to learn to play jazz music, one should be able to join a conservatoire without any tests at any stage of life. It should be easy, effortless.

Â«Â U are learning mathematicsÂ Â». Thinking like a mathematician. I started watching a course on how to move from a state of doing things in mathematics to a state of understanding and thinking. I want to look into how to play in mathematics, it seems like a fun idea. Oh, perhaps it is playing the piano is playing in mathematics. Critical thinking seems to be similar to logical thinking in maths. Documenting my learning. Ultralearning seems like a good idea. I donâ€™t know what to write. Practicing chords from the creative harmony book is so much fun. Code poetry. My plan is to solve simple algorithms on codewars and to continue with Khan Academy maths and sciences and play chords on the piano. During the day I try to spend 20 minutes with free movement, strengthening my muscles and stretching and, and, and, and, and, and. One exercise of mathematical thinking on the coursera course was: try to think of a sentence with and, and, and, and, and, and, consecutive and-s with nothing inbetween them, with some sort of context. I worried about not being able to do this exercise and now I am practicing it. Here is another sentence of the same idea: and, and, and, and, and, and. I could take this idea further and write andandandandand. This reminds me of a memory when I was helping out in a local print shop. The machines made a similar sound. This is fun. ðŸ˜‰
