# 5 minutes to blogging
I am still learning. I am using the Q2 calendar extensively. It is a scheduling tool that I learned from the Stephen Covey book 7 habits. Quadrant two activities are activities that are not urgent but deeply important. So I am trying to fill every 15 minutes with Q2 activities. I am learning sporadically. I found that teaching myself things that I would like to learn at university seems to be a more reasonable choice than paying so much money for learning that is available online. I would be motivated to study at uni though. Anyway, I am using the Khan Academy platfrom to learn many things. It is fun. I spent time today learning biology and physics. Yesterday I spent time learning mathematics. I dreamt that I had an electric guitar.
