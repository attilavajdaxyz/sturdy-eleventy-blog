# I have not been writing morning pages recently
So I will try to write morning typing and document where I am at with mathematics. I found the 3 blue 1 brown youtube channel [Avant dâ€™accÃ©der Ã  YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) and watching videos there and I am learning mathematics visually. I am currently learning about derivatives. I also watched this Ted talk [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_L-fp8gDzY) on why people engage with math. This is a good talk with Jo Boaler and Lex Friedman on how to learn math [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZnGSVwIpeU&pp=ugMICgJmchABGAE%3D).  I am solving puzzles on Khan Academy and watching the videos there and learning a ton. I also started to learn physics. I learnt about magnitude and direction, vectors and scalars and frames of reference. It is a beautiful windy sunshiny day and we went for a walk with Juci and I am enjoying this cup of coffee. I also watched the Big Lebowski again, and I liked it very much. I am listening to the Tao podcast for the fourth time around. I dreamt that I was in high school again.
