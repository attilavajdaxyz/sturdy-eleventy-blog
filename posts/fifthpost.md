# I don‚Äôt have to understand what a static site is to create an 11ty blog
The idea is to document my learning throughout the days and weeks. For example I am doing the easiest algorithms on codewars and I learn a ton. For example I learnt the `uniq` method, `sorted()`, `set()`, `[ $a -lt $b ]` is a conditional operation where the left hand side is less than the right hand side. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I start learning, I found this learning style, like in jiu jitsu, one learns sporadically from the vast array of techniques and over time a unique knowledge develops, as if it was a greater picture built from puzzle pieces. This is similar to what is shown in the Learning How to Learn course and in Barbara Oakley‚Äôs book Mind for Numbers. I am learning how to set up an 11ty page and how to create a blog with 11ty from a starting project.

## Today I learnt

Today I learnt
What is final in Java [Java final Keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_final.asp). Wrote my first program in TypeScript. Final is like const in JavaScript

Is there a way to practice automated testing on codewars?

The idea for today is to do 8-6kyu katas in different languages I am learning and to keep exploring lightly. I do zone two cardio and listened to an episode of the Huberman podcast to ward against depression.

```
function wardAgainstDepression(person){
	person.listen(podcast)
	person.do(zoneTwoCardio)
	while(daytime) {
		!!happy && return person
	} return -1
}
```

I did a codechallenge which was fun, I had to implement a binarySearch function from a diagram in node, and then created a simple blog page in HTML and CSS. Fingers crossed I will get the job and will have a good income and will go üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

How can I write tests to simple programs?

At the end of the day I can share everything on facebook if it is creative.

I‚Äôm just looking at new terms. like fi. - if else fi

```py
if a == 1 or b == 1:
	return False
```

Ez szuperj√≥, csak √≠gy tov√°bb.

`echo $1 | perl -e ‚Äò($_) = <>; s/ +//g; print $_‚Äô`

`echo ${1// /}`

`echo "$1" | tr -d " "`

 `(1..n).inject(:*) || 1`

```rb
def factorial(num)
  return 1 unless num > 0
  num * factorial(num - 1)
end
```


I created a program in Ruby that checks whether a string is made of all upcase letters. I researched whatever I need to create it online. I used the StackOverflow forum and I tried different solutions with regular expressions that didn‚Äôt work for some reason. I saw the term monkey patching. After I solved the exercise I looked at other people‚Äôs solutions and saved a few into my notes, for example:

`self.index(/[a-z]/).nil?`

`/\p{Upper}/`

`scan(/[a-z]/).empty?`

`chars.all? { |c| c == c.upcase }`


```py
x, y = 0, 1
for i in range(n):
    x, y = y, y + x
return x
```

```rb
def count_positives_sum_negatives(lst)
  return [] if lst.nil? || lst.empty?
  [lst.count(&:positive?), lst.select(&:negative?).reduce(0, :+)]
end
```

To see the structure of code. Reading articles improves thinking and speech. Solving little problems, researching, doing, improving, for process. Writing improves speech and thinking.

Making cohesive thought, phrases, sentences.
In terms of a technical blog post, I applied for extra roles and got invited to a casting which I am happy about. I saw The Hand Of God, and I loved this film. I spend time solving algorithms on codewars. The idea is to solve many 6 kyu katas, since they are fun to do and I learn a ton of JavaScript doing it. It is also fun to look at other people‚Äôs code and to know variations to the same problem and one can learn so much from the different solutions. I had an interview for an apprenticeship where I was quite nervous talked quite a bit but didn‚Äôt ask any questions. Nevertheless they said I didn‚Äôt seem passionate for the role. Anyway I wrote a letter to them in response and I got invited to a second interview which went much easier. I took the whole thing much less seriously after having prepared so much for it and because I was rejected. I was rejected for the second interview also. I watched a Front End Masters course on getting an front end job and so I am improving my interviewing skills. Also I am watching another course on interviewing for front end jobs, both from the interviewer and the interviewee‚Äôs point of view. I started using twitter and facebook again. I am doing an Automated Testing course online and preparing for an Automated Testing mentorship, the code challenge will be in January. I also tried to do a challenge for a Java mentorship, but I failed the test. In September I start attending a Front End course online, and I already started networking on Discord for this course. It would be cool to study together with people effectively. I am drinking this cold Elderflower infused alcohol-free beer and it is a summer evening and you can hear the crickets over the music and it is just nice. I listened to a climbing podcast where the host mentioned that he was working for an alcohol-free beer brewery, an unconventional idea, and how cool that is. I also watched To Rome With Love, a super funny film, I felt very nice after watching that film, and it still makes me laugh when I think of it.
