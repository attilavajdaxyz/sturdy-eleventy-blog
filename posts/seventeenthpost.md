I am grateful for this cup of coffee. I found a cool podcast [‚ÄéDaniel and Jorge Explain the Universe on Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daniel-and-jorge-explain-the-universe/id1436616330). I continued learning creative harmony, I practiced the A major #5 9 and Dsus - this is good exercise in recalling the chords that I played. I applied to appreinteiceships and my dopamine went all over the place and I became addicted to looking at my emails üêõ. I like that I figured out that finding a job the traditional way is an accessibility issue and a user experience design problem. Going to college and studying what I would like to is similar. Like the way it should work is that someone wants to do software development then one should be able to join a course and a team easily. If people change their minds and want to learn other things then they could join other teams, mix things to learn and do. So, all of the universities everywhere could be open and people could learn whichever course they wanted to, for free, without grades, without time limits, without requirements, without interviews, etc. would make sense.
